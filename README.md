# eTime Bank

## Introduction
   The purpose of this project is to allow a child to manage their own time using electronic devices. It works as a self-service kiosk where the child can track the time spent on household chores, tasks, homework, etc. The kiosk then dispenses and tracks electronic time available to the child. Included in this repo is a copy of the code and a wiring diagram for the hardware.
